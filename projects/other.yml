  note: MDN is a huge website with more than 11,000 pages. So, instead of building
    all pages, you may selectively delete unnecessary categories under
    `files/en-us` folder. Even though you have all HTML pages in build
    directory, all files are in lowercase whereas links contains camelcase. So,
    tools such as `python -m http.server` and `npx serve` may not be suitable to
    serve these HTML pages. Instead a simple and working approach is to open the
    html pages directly in the browser.
