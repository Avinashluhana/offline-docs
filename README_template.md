## But why? / Motivation

Learning or working on a new language/framework/library often requires referring
to the official docs multiple times. With the rise of **Static Site Generation
(SSG)** many documentation sites are now open-source and can be built for
offline usage. This project aims to collect all such projects and the build
commands to have a knowledge of widely used SSG tools.
